1. Please change the 'Basic Graph' to simple 'Graph'.

2. Update the Makefile of 'Singly Linked List'.

3. Every module should be only concerned about their direct dependency.
   For example,
   Let, Target_Module = A.
   If module A depends on a module called B and if B in turn depends on another module C,
   then the build system of A should not be concerned about building C by itself. The module
   B should be responsible for building C.
